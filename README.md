# PORTFOLIO
This is my first project with microsoft SQL server.
I created insights from a dataset i downloaded online from whe WHO dash board on Covid-19.
In this exciting project, i took the liberty of using my newly developed skills to create insights by querying the dataset. 
I made use of all kind of functions in order to arrive at my results. Some of them include Temp tambles, CTEs, sub-queries, JOINS ETC.
I started by creating a temp table for optimise querries before movinng on to other complex querries.
this project was really insightfull and ai had a lot of fun on it.
