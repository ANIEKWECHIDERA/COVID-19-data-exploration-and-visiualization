# COVID-19 data exploration and visiualization
This is my first project with microsoft SQL server.
I created insights from a dataset i downloaded online from the WHO dash board on Covid-19.
In this exciting project, i took the liberty of using my newly developed skills to create insights by querying the dataset. 
I made use of all kind of functions in order to arrive at my results. Some of them include Temp tambles, CTEs, sub-queries, JOINS ETC.
I started by creating a temp table for optimise querries before moving on to other complex querries.
i completed the project by visualizing it on tableau public (https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID-19DASHBOARD_16798598306050/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
this project was really insightfull and i had a lot of fun on it.
